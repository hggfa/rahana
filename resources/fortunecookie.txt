Think before you speak. Read before you think.
Keep your face always toward the sunshine - and shadows will fall behind you.
Write it on your heart that every day is the best day in the year.
Do not pray for an easy life, pray for the strength to endure a difficult one
To handle yourself, use your head; to handle others, use your heart.
Everything in moderation, including moderation.
Be more concerned with your character than your reputation, because your character is what you really are, while your reputation is merely what others think you are.
Dream as if you will live forever; Live as if you will die today.
The way to happiness: Keep your heart free from hate, your mind from worry. Live simply, expect little, give much. Scatter sunshine, forget self, think of others. Try this for a week and you will be surprised.
The past is behind, learn from it. The future is ahead, prepare for it. The present is here, live it.
Sit in a room and read--and read and read. And read the right books by the right people. Your mind is brought onto that level, and you have a nice, mild, slow-burning rapture all the time.
Don't count the days, make the days count.

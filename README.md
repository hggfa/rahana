## üêâ HERE BE DRAGONS

**This bot is still a work-in-progress and will contain bugs!**

If you manage to find any, please report them [here](https://github.com/South-Paw/discord-music-bot/issues) so they can be squashed.

## Features

* Yes.

## ü§ñ How do I use this?

**You must first have...**

* A `discord token`, `server id` and `text channel id` for your bot, [read this if you don't have those](https://github.com/South-Paw/discord-music-bot/blob/master/docs/discord-getting-user-ids.md)
* The IDs of the users you wish to give admin permissions on the bot to, [read this if you don't have that](https://github.com/South-Paw/discord-music-bot/blob/master/docs/discord-bot-credentials.md)
* A computer that has working internet
* The ability to follow instructions
* Some common sense

And I thought this note would be covered under common sense but:

```
‚ö†Ô∏è --------------------------------- ‚ö†Ô∏è
 |  DO NOT COMMIT OR POST YOUR TOKEN  |
‚ö†Ô∏è --------------------------------- ‚ö†Ô∏è

and if you go do that or already have done it... reset it.
```
